    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This meat pie is delicious! I got it from my husband's mother. She is French so I believe this is a French meat pie recipe. Beef, pork, and potato are all nicely spiced and baked together. It's yummy and pretty easy to make too! It's best served fresh, but you can also make it ahead and freeze or refrigerate it. Serve the pie by itself or with a beef gravy.</p>
